        <p>11straps comeÂ´s with the static site generator Eleventy and the CSS framework 
        Bootstrap 5 in it. It combines both via npm and Gulp and adds some dev and build 
        magic to it. This website itself is also included as example.</p>

        <p>Once you are done with your local development itÂ´s time for a prod build. The 
        11straps prod output is a minified HTML site with a minified and purged CSS file 
        and optimized assets. Thats it. Just a clean, fast and static website will come out.</p>
